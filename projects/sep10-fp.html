            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>The Freedom Project is a year long project in the class of SEP10 Web Design where we choose any topic such as Medicine, Engineering, or in my case Chemical Engineering and researching existing software and hardware tech in that topic. We also had to brainstorm our own innovations for the possible future of our topic. The final part of the Freedom Project is learning a new coding tool and with prior knowledge in web design creating a website about your topic that includes the content that we've been researching all year.</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>For my topic of Chemical Engineering I created a informative website on technology that already exists including some of my own ideas and innovations as well. I created it using HTML that we learned from the start of the year and TailwindCss a framework that has created all the css for you so I can use Tailwind to build my website easily. This website includes a navigation bar, past software and hardware that exists, and my innovations.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Throughout the whole freedom project there were many challenges even if they were easy or hard I've faced a lot of them. Some of these challenges include learning how the code works, figuring out why something doesn't work, or even setting up the code in general. One big challenge that took me the longest to solve was setting up and learning my tool, Tailwindcss. I first tried downlaoding Tailwindcss but after a week it still didn't work and this was when I found out that I should've been using the play cdn link the whole time instead of downloading the whole thing. The next challenge would be learning this tool, what really helped me understand was a guide on the basics of Tailwind that taught me the fundamentals and how to use them. The take</p>
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                 Always read Documentation
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ask for help (Slack or Mr. Mueller or Friends)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take your time (Learn your tool the best way you can to understand it better)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Trust yourself (Even if something seems too hard for you, don't give up.)
                </li>
